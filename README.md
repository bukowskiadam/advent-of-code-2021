# Advent of Code 2021

This is my first attempt to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Good playground to learn [Go](https://go.dev/).

As I use JS/TS on a daily basis, some folders contain original solution written
in JS, then rewritten to Go.

## Run

Use prepared script
```
./run <day> <part> [<input data file without .txt extension>]
```

e.g.:
```
./run 23 2 input-pt2
```

or call go directly like:
```
go run ./23/2 ./23/input-pt2.txt
```
